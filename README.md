This project is my first website dedicated to sharing a little information about myself and my journey towards a new career path in coding.  It was designed with a mobile-first approach.

In CSS, I used Flexbox to design the layout of the site and I also included a CSS animation in the h1 tag to shift between lower case and upper case when the page is loaded.

The JavaScript feature I chose to use was to toggle the list items under my bulleted lists.

 I really enjoyed playing with the CSS features and learning how to join them all to make this great site that really feels like a good reflection of me!  Thanks for checking out my project!
